In our course, we will learn how to use a whole bunch of tools and technologies that form the foundation of data science.

| Category                     | Solution             | Description                                                                |

| Programming Language         | Python              | The language used to write and execute code.                                | 
| Integrated Development Environment (IDE)      | PyCharm             | Editor for writing, debugging, and managing projects (+ many more).                |
| Virtual Environment          | venv                | An isolated environment to manage project-specific package dependencies.            |
| Script / Notebook            | Jupyter Notebook    | An interactive file format/environment for running and documenting code.    |
| Version Control System (VCS) | Git                 | Tracks code changes and manages project history.                            |
| VCS Hosting Platform         | GitHub              | Cloud-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.     |

Below, a detailed instructions on how to set everything up is provided.

### 1) Install PyCharm

- go to: https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students
- fill in the form to get the license, you can use your @cuni.cz email or ISIC
- download and install

### 2) Install git

- [TODO]

### 3) Set up GitHub
- Create an account 
- Create a fork of the course repo
  - https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo
  - A fork enables you to commit your own changes into your separate repo (not the shared one owned by teachers)

### 3) Get the course files - several options ordered by level of recommendation

#### 3.1) Use PyCharm integrated version control
- PyCharm has an integration to GitHub
- Click File -> Project from Version Control (or in the startup window you will see something like "Clone repository" or "VCS")
- Clone your repository by selecting it in the version control and create a project from this folder
- Do not clone the repository into a cloud folder! Use 'users/<me>/repos/data-science-2' foe example
- This will create a project without any Interpreter
- In the bottom right, click on the <No Interpreter>, select "Add New Interpreter" -> "Add Local Interpreter"
- Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.10 (if not present, it will be downloaded)

### 4) Install dependencies
- open Terminal in PyCharm (one of the icons in the left-down corner)
- make sure there is `(.venv)` at the beginning of your command line, denoting you are now in the activated virtual environment, that you created in the previous steps
- install [TODO]

### 5) Run Jupyter
- [TODO]
