In our course, we will learn how to use a whole bunch of tools and technologies that form the foundation of data science.

| Programming Language         | Python              | The language used to write and execute code.                                | 
| Integrated Development Environment (IDE)      | PyCharm             | Editor for writing, debugging, and managing projects (+ many more).                |
| Virtual Environment          | venv                | An isolated environment to manage project-specific package dependencies.            |
| Script / Notebook            | Jupyter Notebook    | An interactive file format/environment for running and documenting code.    |
| Version Control System (VCS) | Git                 | Tracks code changes and manages project history.                            |
| VCS Hosting Platform         | GitHub              | Cloud-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.     |

Below, a detailed instructions on how to set everything up is provided.

### 1) Install PyCharm

- Go to [PyCharm Student License Form](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students)
- Fill in the form to get the license, you can use your @cuni.cz email or ISIC
- Download and install

### 2) Install git

- (Windows) [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) the installer (presumably, you need Git for Windows/x64 Setup), use recommended and defult settings to install it, verify installation by typing 'git --version' in your Command Prompt
- (Mac) Install Xcode, verify installation by typing 'git --version' in your Terminal

### 3) Create GitHub account

- Go to [GitHub](https://www.github.com)
- Create your account
- Create a course repository fork by navigating to 'fork' [here](https://github.com/ondratybl/python-for-data-science), we strongly encourage you to use keep the default repository name
- A fork enables you to commit your own changes into your separate repository

#### 3) Create project

- Open Pycharm
- Select 'Get from VCS' to connect to your repository, use url https://github.com/[username]/python-for-data-science and select 'Clone'

### 4) Create python environment
- In the bottom right, click on the <No Interpreter>, select "Add New Interpreter" -> "Add Local Interpreter"
- Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.11 (if not present, it will be downloaded)
- open Terminal in PyCharm (one of the icons in the left-down corner)
- make sure there is `(.venv)` at the beginning of your command line, denoting you are now in the activated virtual environment, that you created in the previous steps
- install all necessary packages by typing 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

### 5) Run Jupyter
- navigate to 'test.ipyng' in the left and double-click
- select 'run' to test that everything works properly

### 6) Congratulations!

You are now ready to create your code.
